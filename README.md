**This is for my studying MongoDB Expressjs Nodejs and Reactjs that is forked from [edroh/mer-social-media](https://github.com/ed-roh/mern-social-media), so I will create more features in this app in the future** 

## Setup the project
1. Open this project in your editor program.
2. Under the folder /mern-social-media/server create file name `.env` and edit like this

    MONGO_URL = '(your MONGODB connection string)'
  
    PORT = (PORT you want, in this code it's 3001)
      
    JWT_SECRET = '(Your secret key. in this code it's ` somesuperhardstringtoguess ` )'

then save the file.

3. Open terminal (for starting reactjs) and change directory to the project folder:
- cd client
- npm install
4. Open new terminal (for starting nodejs and expressjs) and change directory to the project folder:
- cd server
- npm install

## How to Run

Starting client, new terminal and change directory to the project folder and then:
- cd client
- npm start

Starting server, new terminal and change directory to the project folder and then:
- cd server
- npm start
